  Code for transmitting and receiving tests 
  with UART type LoRa E220 modules

  The desired mode of operation will be coded 
  by the variable variable "MODE" being 1 for 
  transmitter and 0 for receiver.

  Pins can be varied between development boards, 
  verify connections or make the necessary 
  modifications before uploading the code. You can 
  choose between development boards with 1 for XIAO 
  and 0 for WeMos D1.
